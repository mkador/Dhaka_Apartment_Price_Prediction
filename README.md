# Dhaka_Apartment_Price_Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict apartment prices in Dhaka using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on real estate data and provides insights into how various factors influence apartment prices.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering for better predictions
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models
- Model evaluation and performance metrics

# Installation
- Clone the repository: `git clone YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd Dhaka_Apartment_Price_Prediction`
- Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `python -m venv venv
 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate``
- Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r`
- Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook Dhaka_Apartment_Price_Prediction.ipynb`

# Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step by step.
- Modify dataset parameters to test different scenarios.
- Train different machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
- Generate predictions based on new input data.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of apartment listings in Dhaka with features such as:
- Location
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Apartment size (square feet)
- Price

# Model Performance
The notebook implements and compares multiple machine learning models such as:
- Linear Regression
